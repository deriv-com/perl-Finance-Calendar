=head2 get_exchange_open_times

Query an exchange for valid opening times. Expects 3 parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$exchange> - a L<Finance::Exchange> instance

=item * C<$date> - a L<Date::Utility>

=item * C<$which> - which market information to request, see below

=back

The possible values for C<$which> include:

=over 4

=item * C<daily_open>

=item * C<daily_close>

=item * C<trading_breaks>

=back

Returns either C<undef>, a single L<Date::Utility>, or an arrayref of L<Date::Utility> instances.
